# 🏫 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++

This folder contains **C++ programs** that demonstrate the core principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** such as **classes, objects, constructors, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and operator/function overloading**.

⭐ If you find this project useful, don’t forget to give it a star!

## 📌 Programs Included

1. **StudentClass.cpp** → Define a class `Student` with attributes and methods.  
2. **RectangleClass.cpp** → Implement a `Rectangle` class with area and perimeter.  
3. **BankAccount.cpp** → Create a `BankAccount` with deposit and withdraw functionality.  
4. **CopyConstructor.cpp** → Demonstrate the use of a copy constructor.  
5. **ComplexClass.cpp** → Implement addition and subtraction for complex numbers.  
6. **FunctionOverloading.cpp** → Demonstrate **function overloading** with different parameter lists.  
7. **OperatorOverloading.cpp** → Overload the `+` operator for adding two objects.  
8. **InheritanceDemo.cpp** → Demonstrate **inheritance** with base (`Shape`) and derived (`Circle`, `Square`) classes.  
9. **PolymorphismDemo.cpp** → Show **runtime polymorphism** using virtual functions.  
10. **EncapsulationDemo.cpp** → Demonstrate **encapsulation** with private variables and public methods.
